# firmforge

**A Rust-first monorepo for a cross-platform firmware companion app — desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) and mobile (Android/iOS) — that discovers, downloads, verifies and flashes firmware straight from a GitHub repository's `firmware/` folder.**

Built on [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/), which is the only mainstream Rust application framework that ships **one codebase to both desktop and mobile**.

---

## Why this exists

Flashing firmware to ESP32-class devices today means juggling `esptool.py`, PlatformIO, vendor web-flashers, Discord links to `.bin` files, and a lot of tribal knowledge. Projects like **Bruce**, **ESP32 Marauder**, **ESPHome** and **M5Burner** each solved a slice of it. `firmforge` aims to be the *companion app layer*: a signed, versioned, GitHub-backed firmware catalogue with a one-tap flash + post-flash device console, on the desktop **and** the phone in your pocket.
